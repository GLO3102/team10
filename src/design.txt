Team 10

How to :
1. Open index.html in WebStorm
2. For the three main pages (movies/actors/tvshows) 6 samples are provided dynamically. If you want a specific sample, you can change the ID in the URL, choose a movie in an actor's movie list, or use the search engine to find what you are looking for.
3. You can see your own watchlists on the Watchlist page and in your profile.

First advanced feature:
Every user has his associated Gravatar: You can see it when you are logged in (on the header) or on your profile page (Dropdown menu in the header -> Profile)

Second advanced feature:
Autocompletion using the search engine: on the search bar in the header, you can start writing text and it will show you results matching what you have written. It also works for the search bar in the Search page.
